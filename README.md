# shenzhen-io
Computer Architecture final project

Description

Motivation

## Required software

- python3
  - numpy
- Icarus Verilog
- gtkwave

## How to run

To run the python assembler, run:
```bash
python3 assembler/assemble.py PathToAssemblyFile PathToMachineCodeFile loop
```
This will assemble the assembly file into machine code, with a line at the end that jumps to the beginning. If you don't want to have the line at the end that jumps to the beginning, write something else instead of `loop`.
